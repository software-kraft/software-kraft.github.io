Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in\n            an online shop.

Collection of general data and information</h4>\n          <p>\n            The website of the Jose Riquelme & Jakub Nieznalski UG collects a\n            series of general data and information when a data subject or\n            automated system calls up the website. This general data and\n            information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1)\n            the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used\n            by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing\n            system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the\n            sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,\n            (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet\n            service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar\n            data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our\n            information technology systems.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            When using these general data and information, the Jose Riquelme &\n            Jakub Nieznalski UG does not draw any conclusions about the data\n            subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the\n            content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our\n            website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term\n            viability of our information technology systems and website\n            technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the\n            information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a\n            cyber-attack. Therefore, the Jose Riquelme & Jakub Nieznalski UG\n            analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically,\n            with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of\n            our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the\n            personal data we process.

The definition of cookies is explained\n            above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze\n            the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual\n            pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and\n            into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet\n            browser on the information technology system of the data subject\n            will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics\n            component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement\n            of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical\n            procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal\n            information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which\n            serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and\n            clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access\n            time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency\n            of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our\n            Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the\n            Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to\n            Google in the United States of America.

Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used\n            would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the\n            information technology system of the data subject. In addition,\n            cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any\n            time via a web browser or other software programs.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a\n            collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is\n            related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of\n            this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this\n            purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the\n            link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This\n            browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any\n            data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be\n            transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser\n            add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information\n            technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted,\n            or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser\n            add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was\n            uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is\n            attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is\n            possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the\n            browser add-ons.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of\n            Google may be retrieved under\n            https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under\n            http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.

Legal basis for the processing </h4>\n          <p>\n            Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing\n            operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing\n            purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the\n            performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is\n            the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for\n            the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing\n            is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such\n            processing operations which are necessary for carrying out\n            pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries\n            concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a\n            legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,\n            such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is\n            based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of\n            personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the\n            data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case,\n            for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name,\n            age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to\n            be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the\n            processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally,\n            processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR.\n            This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not\n            covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is\n            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by\n            our company or by a third party, except where such interests are\n            overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of\n            the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such\n            processing operations are particularly permissible because they have\n            been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He\n            considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data\n            subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>\n            12. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third\n            party\n          </h4>\n          <p>\n            Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.\n            f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor\n            of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>13. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>\n          <p>\n            The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal\n            data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration\n            of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long\n            as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or\n            the initiation of a contract.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>\n            14. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual\n            requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;\n            Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;\n            possible consequences of failure to provide such data{\" \"}\n          </h4>\n          <p>\n            We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by\n            law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual\n            provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes\n            it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject\n            provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed\n            by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with\n            personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The\n            non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that\n            the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before\n            personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must\n            contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject\n            whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or\n            contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether\n            there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the\n            consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>15.
